git clone https://github.com/yilozt/rounded-window-corners
cd rounded-window-corners
yarn install && yarn ext:install
```

In NixOS, you can use `nix-shell` to enter a development shell before

You may need to install those packages when building this extensions. Feel free

```

## Translations

[![weblate-state][12]][13]

You can help translate this extensions by using [Weblate][13], or update po
files then open a pull request.

To add new translations for extensions, you can add `.po` files in `po`
directory via `msginit`, then use your favorite text editor to edit it.

```bash
cd po && msginit   # Add po file for new translations
```

You can run `yarn ext:install` or `yarn dev` to install extensions with with
new translations. In XOrg sessions, just press `Alt + F2 -> r` to restart
gnome-session then preview the result. In Wayland session, have to logout
session then login again to reload extensions.

`yarn dev` will watch changes of `.po` files, once you have update translations,
it will compile and install extensions automatically.

## Development

### Build

```bash
yarn build 
```

### Watch files

Build and install extensions when files in `src` folder changed.

```
yarn dev
```

### Test in Virtual Box by Vagrant

Need to install [`Vagrant`](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant) and
Virtual Box. This command will setup a virtual machine that enable log of
extensions in terminal.

```
yarn vm
```
