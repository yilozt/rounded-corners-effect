## Compatibility

- [_Compiz alike magic lamp effect_](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3740/compiz-alike-magic-lamp-effect/)

  Need to restart (disable then enable) this extension when _Compiz alike magic lamp effect_ enabled.

## Translations

[![](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/rounded-window-corners/-/rounded-window-corners/multi-auto.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/rounded-window-corners/)

You can help translate this extensions by using [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/rounded-window-corners/), or update po files then open a pull request.

To add new translations for extensions, you can add empty `.po` file in `po` directory, then use `yarn po` or `yarn dev` to fill it. 

```bash
touch po/zh_CN.po  # replace zh_CN to the locales you want to add
yarn po            # auto fill po file
vim po/zh_CN.po    # now let's start edit
```

You can run `yarn ext:install` or `yarn dev` to install extensions with with new translations. In XOrg sessions, just press `Alt + F2 -> r` to restart gnome-session then preview the result.

`yarn dev` will watch changes of `.po` files, once you have update translations, it will compile and install extensions automatically.

## Development

### Build

```bash
yarn build 
```

### Watch files

Build and install extensions when files in `src` folder changed.

```
yarn dev
```

### Test in Virtual Box by Vagrant

Need to install [`Vagrant`](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant) and Virtual Box. This command will setup a virtual machine that enable log of extensions in terminal.

```
yarn vm
```
